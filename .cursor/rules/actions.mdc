Implement any action or tool assuming the input is a dict and the result must also be a json serializable dict.

Assume the  the main input is in the field `input` as a string and produce the output in the field `output` as a string.

You can add additional fields as additional and complex results. Produce a complex output creating an `html` field in html format.
