When you need  to test a <module> of <tool> in <package> , access the modules with:

```
import sys
sys.path.append("packages/<package>/<tool>")
import <module>
```

You need a $HOME/.wskprops file to execute the tests. If it is not there execute `ops ide login` and ask the user to provide the credentials.

Do not add mocks or stubs.

Assume you can access relevant services (redis, postgres, milvus, s3) using environment variables that are provided.

Test the <function>s and <class>ess in the <module> referring to them as

<module>.<function> or <module>.<class>
